To get started, try:

  $ make run

You may need to coerce QEMU and the display variable, e.g.:

  $ make run qemu=/usr/bin/my-qemu qemu-display=sdl

Or, if you just build it (with make), the output files will be written to the
out/ directory - so you can try booting it manually!

Once running in the shell, try running the Mandelbrot program:

  > /usr/mandelbrot

(the shell is extremely basic, and does not support path resolution)
