Hello, and welcome to StACSOS: the St Andrews Computer Science Operating System

-----

One of your coursework tasks is to implement the 'ls' command - so there's
currently no way to list the contents of the filesystem in the shell.

However, you can either:

  (a) Look at the generated rootfs.tar file in the out/ directory, on the host
      system, e.g. tar tf rootfs.tar

  (b) Look at the provided applications in the user/ directory.

  (c) Run /usr/mandelbrot or /usr/poweroff

Enjoy!
